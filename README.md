# Infinite use of finite means? Evaluating the generalization of center embedding learned from an artificial grammar

This is the repository of materials for the paper "Infinite use of finite means? Evaluating the generalization of center embedding learned from an artificial grammar" by [R. Thomas McCoy](http://rtmccoy.com/), [Jennifer Culbertson](https://jennifer-culbertson.github.io/), [Paul Smolensky](https://www.microsoft.com/en-us/research/people/psmo/), and [GÃ©raldine Legendre](https://cogsci.jhu.edu/directory/geraldine-legendre/).

# Experiment code

Our experiment was created using [jspsych](https://www.jspsych.org/), with help from [this template](https://github.com/djnavarro/blankex) by Danielle Navarro. The code for the experiment is in the directpry `experiment/`. You can try out a demo of the experiment [here](http://rtmccoy.com/center_embedding.html).
